Welcome to the Hacktober Fest Blog Project!

My name is [Cecy](https://twitter.com/cecycorrea),and I got the idea of starting a crowd sourced blog to give those new to open source a way to contribute beyond just code.

I believe contributing to open source goes beyond coding. It includes thought leadership in the form of knowledge sharing as well.

How many of us benefit of blog posts? 

I know a lot of what I have learned as a developer has come from blog posts and people's willingness to share their knowledge, so that is why I started the Hacktober Fest Blog Project!

I am looking for contributions to this project in the form of blog posts / thought leadership. You can contribute any type of blog post you want, as long as it is constructive and it provides value to the community.

Share ideas, tips, tutorials, reviews, etc that you think the open source community would find helpful. 

At the end of the month, I will turn all contributions into a free open source ebook :)
