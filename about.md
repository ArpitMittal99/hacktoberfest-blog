Hacktober Fest is a yearly month-long [hackathon](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) put on by Digital Ocean and Github, to encourage contributions to open source.

I believe contributions to open source also include thought leadership, so this is a collection of blog posts from the community for the community.

At the end of the month, all posts will be compiled into a free ebook :)

Happy Hacktober Fest! ðŸŽƒ
